# Hi there :wave:

I'm a mostly self taught programmer that usually goes by Nightowl (or just Owl), and I've been programming my own projects since 2015.

I like to reinvent the wheel for learning purposes, which is why a lot of my pinned projects exist,
however I do also use them personally as I like having my own bespoke infrastructure.


Over the years I have created many C# libraries and WPF applications, although I'm hoping to be able to move to either Avalonia or .NET Maui soon.

Currently my projects that are shown on github are meant to be a showcase, rather than being for public use, however that will change at one point!

*Yep, thats all, I like to keep it simple.*
